# assignment_renamer

A python script that uses **Google's Vision API** to rename my problem sets based on which question I've answered on which page. 

Normally when finished, I'd take a picture of my assignement and WhatsApp it to myself because downloading it from google photos takes too long.

Then, I drag them from my WhatsApp to my desktop.

The jpegs on my desktop look like this e52d6e80-813f-474a-bc5b-f1e54d300e9e.jpg and so its really easy to accidentally reupload a question I have already 
submitted. 

The idea is to take e52d6e80-813f-474a-bc5b-f1e54d300e9e.jpg and convert it into pset1 1a)

This alleviates my stress and is immensely helpful when it comes to crunch time!
